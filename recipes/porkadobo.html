    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Adobo is really a kind of cooking method, originating in the Philippines. 
            It involves simmering meat and even seafood in a mixture of vinegar, soy sauce, and garlic.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds pork shoulder</li>
            <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white vinegar</li>
            <li>1/3 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>6 cloves chopped garlic</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>2 tspn whole back peppercorn</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix the ground pork, minced shrimp, onion, celery, carrot, soy sauce, egg and a little salt and pepper by hand. 
                If necessary, chop on a cutting board to ensure that it everything is fine and well incorporated. Heat a little peanut oil in a 
                small frying pan, and cook a teaspoon of the filling to check for taste. Adjust seasoning as necessary. The filling can be prepared 
                up to a day in advance and chilled in the refrigerator in a tightly sealed container.</li>
            <li>To roll the lumpia, I find that it helps to separate the wrappers in advance; cover with a damp paper towel to prevent from drying out. 
                Take the wrapper and place on your work surface on a diagonal so one point is facing you. Place about 1 tablespoon of filling towards 
                the bottom of the egg roll. Turn up the bottom corner and roll upwards. Fold in the left and right corners, making sure the filling is 
                nicely packed, with no air pockets. Continue rolling. Dip you finger in water, pat it on the remaining corner and finish rolling the 
                lumpia, sealing the edge. The lumpia should be about 1/2 inch in diameter. Continue rolling until your lumpias are done, 
                there should be enough filling for about 125 lumpia.</li>
            <li>Keep the lumpia covered in a single layer in the refrigerator with a damp paper towel over top until ready to fry, or freeze in an air 
                tight container for later.</li>
            <li>To fry the lumpia, heat the peanut oil in a deep fryer or deep sided skillet to 350 degrees. Working in batches, add the lumpia about 
                4-6 at a time, and fry until golden brown. You will know the the lumpia are ready when they are golden brown, and the filling is fully 
                cooked; this should take about 4 minutes for freshly rolled lumpia, or about 6 minutes for frozen. Let the lumpia drain on a rimmed 
                platter lined with paper towels.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately with your favorite Asian dipping sauce.</li>
